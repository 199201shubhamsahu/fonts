There are already many Caslon revivals, and some are very good, but this is the first that is truly made for the web.
However it also looks great when printed and achieves good readability in both media.

It is tailored for use in body text sizes, so it can be used at very small sizes and will still be readable on your website.
The companion family <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Caslon+Display">Libre Caslon Display</a> is optimized for headlines and large text sizes.

Another big difference is that pretty much all other digital Caslons revivals are based on 18th Century specimens by William Caslon I and William Caslon II. Libre Caslon, instead, is based on hand lettering artist Caslon interpretations typical of 1950s advertising.

Initially designed by Pablo Impallari in 2015, with kerning by Igino Marini and <a href="https://www.ikern.com">iKern</a>, the family was upgraded to a variable font in 2019 by Stephen Nixon.
