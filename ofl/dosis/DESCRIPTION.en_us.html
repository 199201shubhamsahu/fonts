It started with the ExtraLight style, intended for use at 36pt sized text, with an Extended Latin glyph set that included many alternative characters, all designed by Edgar Tolentino and Pablo Impallari.
Dosis was expanded into a complete set of weights by Pablo in 2011, and remastered as a Variable Font in 2019 by Eli Heuer.
