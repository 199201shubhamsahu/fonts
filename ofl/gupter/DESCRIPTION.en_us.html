<p>Gupter is a condensed serif font which takes inspiration from early 20th century English fonts such as Times New Roman.</p>

<p>Its large x-height and condensed width make it suitable for uses where the economy of space is needed. The light stems and the subtle details give it a gentle personality and a nice color balance on the page.</p>
